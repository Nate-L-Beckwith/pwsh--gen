### Step 3: Create a Zip Package
Once you have your project files organized, zip them into a single archive. This is the package you'll upload to GitHub for release.

- On Windows, you can right-click the folder, select **Send to**, and then choose **Compressed (zipped) folder**.
- Name the zip file, for example, `pause_screensaver_app.zip`.

### Step 4: Upload to GitHub as a Release

#### 1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in (or create an account if you don't have one).
- Create a new repository:
  - Go to the **Repositories** tab and click **New**.
  - Name your repository something like `pause-screensaver-app`.
  - Optionally, add a description, and choose whether the repository will be public or private.
  - Click **Create repository**.

#### 2. **Upload Your Files to GitHub:**
- Once the repository is created, you’ll see a page prompting you to either upload your files or initialize it with a README.
- Use the **Upload files** button to add your `install_pause_savers.ps1`, `pause_savers.ps1`, `README.md`, and any other files (like a `LICENSE` file).

#### 3. **Create a GitHub Release:**
- Go to the **Releases** section of your GitHub repository by clicking the **Releases** tab on the right sidebar.
- Click **Draft a new release**.
  - Tag the release (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
  - Give it a release title (e.g., `Pause Screensaver App v1.0.0`).
  - Provide a description of the release, listing the features and how it works (this can be similar to your README).
- Scroll down to the **Assets** section and upload the `.zip` file you created in Step 3.

#### 4. **Publish the Release:**
- Once you've filled in all the information, click **Publish release**.

### Step 5: Testing the Release
Now that you've created the GitHub release, anyone can download the app and install it by following these steps:

1. Go to the **Releases** section of your GitHub repository and download the `.zip` file.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Run the `install_pause_savers.ps1` script to install the app.

### Optional: Create an Installation Batch File
To simplify the installation process for users who may not be familiar with PowerShell, you can also include a batch file (`install.bat`) in the package that runs the PowerShell installer for them.

Here’s an example `install.bat` file:

```batch
@echo off
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install_pause_savers.ps1
pause
